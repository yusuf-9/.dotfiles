Issues in neovim config - 
- Git diff view is pretty trash
- I need a plugin like gitlens for viewing past commits, inspecting past commit changes, and making edits
- multicursor editing is buggy at times
- lack of AI autocomplete
- lack of AI chat
- lack of AI agentic coding companion
- need a better setup for keyword searching in a file. Needs to work like the VScode search feature
- Need spell-check
- Need to allow searching for folders/files in neotree
- need to make neovim look better (lualine, bufferline, error diagnostics, etc)
- need to add keybindings for jumping to error diagnostics and stuff
